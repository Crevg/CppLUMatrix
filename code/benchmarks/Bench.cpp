 * - an void prepare(const size_t size) method, that initializes the

 *   method is called outside the performance measurements.
 * - an inline void eval() method that performs the evaluation.
 *
 * The following variables are available in PREFIX and CODE:
 * - size holds the current evaluated size (type size_t)
 * - s    holds the index of the current evaluated size
 * - i    index of the current repetition
